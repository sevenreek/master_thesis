abstract = {Achieving solutions to environmental problems that we face today requires long-term potential actions for sustainable development. In this regard, renewable energy resources appear to be the one of the most efficient and effective solutions. That is why there is an intimate connection between renewable energy and sustainable development. Anticipated patterns of future energy use and consequent environmental impacts (focussing on acid precipitation, stratospheric ozone depletion and the greenhouse effect) are comprehensively discussed in this paper. Also, potential solutions to current environmental problems are identified along with renewable energy technologies. The relations between renewable energy and sustainable development are described with practical cases, and an illustrative example is presented. Throughout the paper several issues relating to renewable energy, environment and sustainable development are examined from both current and future perspectives. It is believed that the conclusions and recommendations drawn in the present study will be useful to energy scientists and engineers and policy makers.}
