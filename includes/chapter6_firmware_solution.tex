\section{HXRM firmware}
Based on the results of research and simulations, the best timing
and shaping algorithms were implemented in hardware.
The ADQ14 uses Verilog and Vivado 2015.2, so these tools
were chosen for the implementation of the HXRM.
The developed system performs pulse detection,
measures the peak height, stores the resultant spectrum
and periodically transfer the results to the host PC.
